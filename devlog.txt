BlueSushi's DevLog:

We introduced our idea and how to play BS to Ida, our new team member. We reviewed our proposal and thought about where to start tackling the game. Although we had previously wanted to implement a way for two separate human users to play, we realized, after discussing the issue with classmates and the internet, that it might be too time-consuming and too difficult. :(
We also resent Mr. Brown the proposal email/resubmitted the google doc form/updated the GitHub repo's name to reflect the addition to our team :)

The Planning Process! 
We've decided on the following classes:
  -Card
  -Player
  -Driver
  -AI aka Computer (w/ subclasses that are easy, hard, etc.)
  
We decided that because BS would be ridiculously easy if we had only two players (player v. computer), we are spliting the deck into four, and the winner will be determined by the best out of two games. 
Also, we will likely use a sprite sheet for GUI...

GUI features thus far:
 -"End Turn" button
 -Cards
 -Some kind of poker table
 
Card Class features...
 -Suit (String)
 -Face Value (ex: "Q")
 -Actual Value (ex: J = 11)
 
 Woohoo! Moving along...
