We introduced our idea and how to play BS to Ida, our new team member. We reviewed our proposal and thought about where to start tackling the game. Although we had previously wanted to implement a way for two separate human users to play, we realized, after discussing the issue with classmates and the internet, that it might be too time-consuming and too difficult. :(
We also resent Mr. Brown the proposal email/resubmitted the google doc form/updated the GitHub repo's name to reflect the addition to our team :)

The Planning Process! 
We've decided on the following classes:
  -Card
  -Player
  -Driver
  -AI aka Computer (w/ subclasses that are easy, hard, etc.)
  
We decided that because BS would be ridiculously easy if we had only two players (player v. computer), we are spliting the deck into four, and the winner will be determined by the best out of two games. 
Also, we will likely use a sprite sheet for GUI...

GUI features thus far:
 -"End Turn" button
 -Cards
 -Some kind of poker table
 
Card Class features...
 -Suit (String)
 -Face Value (ex: "Q")
 -Actual Value (ex: J = 11)
 
 Woohoo! Moving along...

In class, we worked on one computer and coded the basics of the basics. We constructed a basic Card class, Hand class, Computer class, and Driver class. More importantly, we continued to discuss the algorithms behind our project.

Looked into possiblity of some better ways to diagram our classes. Remembered that I used a web diagramming website called MindMeister for a freshman year global history project. Created an account on MindMeister and transferred what we had on paper to the web. Sent this to the other members- tentative as to whether we will continue using it.

Added a little more to our current files. Beginning to mess with GUI since we decided it was better to do the GUI concurrently but GUI seems to be a challenge. Currently, I can only produce a nice gray screen with an accurate title. I was able to (re)learn how to read from a text file. Hooray!

Added the Deck class. This class creates a shuffled deck ready to use! Also added a few testers/methods in other classes. Staying away from GUI for as long as possible, aha.

We had a little trouble trying to set the background of our GUI window to our desired color. This is because we first attempted to just "setBackground(Color.YELLOW), which produced nothing. After some research (aka Googling), we realized that we had to call the ContentPane. Hence, we had to do getContentPane.setBackground(Color.YELLOW). YAY!
