A popular game, known through out the land as "Bullshit", in textbooks as "I Doubt It" and across the sea in the ole 
land of Britain as "Cheat", "BS" is an addictive card game that is played at parties and during times of boredom. 
The game may be played by 2-10 players, though in our version, there are 2 players: the user and the computer, using
a standard deck of cards. 

How to Play:
===========
After all cards are dealt out to the players (because 52 is not divisible by all numbers 2-10 evenly, some players
may have more cards than others) the person with the 2 of spades may place their card down. The players then
take turns placing down cards in a circular motion (turns go either clockwise or counterclockwise).
