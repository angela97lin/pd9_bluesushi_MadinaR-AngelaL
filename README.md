TeamGemini: BS
==========

A popular game, known through out the land as "Bullshit", in textbooks as "I Doubt It" and across the sea in the ole 
land of Britain as "Cheat", "BS" is an addictive card game that is played at parties and during times of boredom. 
The game may be played by 2-10 players, though in our version, there are 2 players: the user and the computer, using
a standard deck of cards. 

How to Play:
===========
After all cards are dealt out to the players (because 52 is not divisible by all numbers 2-10 evenly, some players
may have more cards than others) the person with the Ace of spades may place their card down first. The players then
take turns placing down cards in an ascending order. The first player must discard an Ace, the second a 2, the third player must discard a 3, etc. A 10 is followed by a Jack, Queen, then King, and afterwards, the cycle reverts back to
Ace. All cards discarded are placed into a center pile, face down.

A player may place down any card, even if it does not match what the player should be putting down.

Any player who suspects that the card(s) placed down by another player do not match the rank called can call "BS" or
"Bullshit" and challenge the validity of the play. At this point, the cards that have been placed down are overturned and the play is tested.
  1. If the cards are all of the rank that was called, the challenge will be nullified, and the person who called "BS" must pick up the whole center pile.
  2. If the cards are not all of the rank that was called, the challenge will be justified, and the person who last played the cards will have to pick up the whole center pile.

After the challenge is resolved, the play continues in a normal fashion. He/She who clears his hand first by ridding himself of all the cards wins the game.
